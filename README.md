# PyTacToe
TicTacToe for the CASIO fx-CG50. The game was written for the 2nd time and it's now ready to have a public repository. It supports multiplayer and singleplayer with an easy, a medium and a hard AI. Good luck winning them.

On the CASIO fx-CG50, load this game using the Link application and use the Python program to run it. On PCs, use `python PyTacToe.py` on Windows and `python3 PyTacToe.py` on Linux.

The game is around 20kB. If you want to save space on the calculator, the script `CommentRemover.py` removes comments and empty lines from the game and outputs the result to a smaller file that you can more easily load into a calculator. To run this script:

Windows: `python CommentRemover.py PyTacToe.py [output file]`

Linux: `python3 CommentRemover.py PyTacToe.py [output file]`
